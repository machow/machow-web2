```raw
A blind dog pokes around the
yard. Feels the wind on her mustache.
Collects burrs in her coat.
She tip toes over an invisible boundary
into the Neighbors Yard. Sniffs around,
then lays down to munch on some shit.
Her shit.

"Come back over here." -- Someone
She stays there, and is sort of
there, sort of here, then here.
```
