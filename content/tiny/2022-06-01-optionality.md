```raw
My boss carries three pens, one black
one blue one red. Everyday he writes
his novel in black pen. It's arduous.
He sweats as he writes, and every day
discusses a hurdle, the old ones:
a block, a junction with two roads
no one wants to commit to. The new
ones: a loveless marriage, plumbing
issues.

After 700 pages of black pen
he finishes.
