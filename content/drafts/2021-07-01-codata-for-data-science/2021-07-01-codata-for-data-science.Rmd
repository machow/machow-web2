Takeaway: codata is about "subclassing" your actions

* singledispatch lets you add new actions to classes
* it requires you create a function to represent your action
* what if you only wanted to change the **behavior** of some actions?

Example: Truncating a date in SQL

* postgresql: DATE_TRUNC(MONTH, column_name)
* bigquery: DATETIME_TRUNC(column_name, MONTH)

Options:

Common choices are either impossible, or change the user interface.

* subclass sql.column
  - often impossible for parent classes or ones shared across libraries
* create a visitor
  - poor ergonomics
  - like if a data class always took an action as an argument
* **create a data decorator**
  - retains same user interface
