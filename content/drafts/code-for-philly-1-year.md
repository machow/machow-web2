Around this time last year, I found myself browsing Meetup.com events for an organization called Code for Philly (CfP).
I had just passed the two year mark out of graduate school, now working as a data scientist, and was looking volunteer some of my time to help out local organizations.
After attending some of their social events, I still felt in the dark about how to get started at CfP and what to do.
Unsure of how to proceed, I realized that helping volunteers find projects was itself a project, and was listed on the CfP website.

In the year that's followed, I've had the opportunity to volunteer as a projects co-lead at CfP.
In this role I've served as a facilitator, helping organizations recruit volunteers to tackle technical problems.

In what follows, I hope that frankly describing my experiences with volunteering at CfP can be helpful in three ways…

* volunteers benefit from working directly with non-profit organizations around them.
* "non-technical" roles, like project and product management are critical to a project's success.
* non-profits organizations often are great drivers of volunteer work.

Ultimately, my work at CfP has mostly involved watching incredible people roll up their sleeves and work, and this work largely speaks for itself.
As a result, I'll briefly describe what exactly Code for Philly is, exactly how I got involved, and spend the rest of this post describing three cases of organizations using CfP to solve technical problems.

## What is Code for Philly?

Founded in 2012, Code for Philly (CfP) is an organization that works to facilitate civic engagement, by providing physical and digital spaces for people who want to volunteer their time and technical (or non-technical) talents. The term co-lead is a bit misleading, since 99% of what I do is helping people and organizations who want to start projects, to get them off the ground.

Code for Philly does this by…

* hosting recurring "hack nights", where volunteers can gather to work on projects
* hosting presentations to kick-off projects
* providing a website, and slack channel to help raise visibility and organize work

## Case studies in recruiting volunteers from technical communities

[TODO]

### Philadelphia Community Bail Fund

> From May 2017 to June 2019, we've bailed out 130 people held in Philadelphia jails simply because they could not afford to buy back their freedom. We've posted bail as low as $50 and as high as $50,000. Roughly 50% of those who we've bailed out are women and over 90% are Black and Brown people.

### Prevention Point Philadelphia

> The term ‘harm reduction’ refers to policies, programs, and practices that aim to reduce the harm associated with drug use in people unable or unwilling to stop. The primary features of harm reduction are the focus on the prevention of harm (rather than on eliminating drug use itself) and the focus on people who use drugs.

### Philadelphia Lawyers for Social Equity

> PLSE’s mission is to work toward just outcomes for low-income individuals who have had contact with the Pennsylvania criminal justice system. Through individual representation, strategic litigation, community education, research, and legislative advocacy, PLSE advocates for a more equitable social environment for those with criminal records, including expanding access to employment and social services.

## Summary

* I didn't realize it, but I needed to get in touch with the people closes to the issues: non-profit orgs.
* People willing to take on project and product management roles are critical for the success of a project.
* Non-profit organizations who are close to the issues, and the people involved, are critical for driving volunteer work.
